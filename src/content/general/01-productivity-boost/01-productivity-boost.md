<small>on a mac</small>

I've been having fun of trying to maximise the productivity. In this post, I am purely focus on the visible part, like setting up your machine, memeroize shortcuts.

# Be afraid of mouse -- app navigation

How do I open an app? How do I switch to a webpage? How do I view the calendar in Outlook? How do I ...?

DO NOT USE YOUR MOUSE! USE SHORTCUTS

The very basic command on mac for switch apps are `CMD+Tab` and ``CMD+`(backtick)``

`CMD+Tab` will allow you to switch between different applications. While the ``CMD+`(backtick)`` will allow you to switch between different windows within an app itself.

But when you have lots of apps opend, it could take you many `CMD+Tab` before you can land on you desire app. There's a trick, use SPOTLIGHT!

To activate spotlight, the default shortcut is `CMD+<Space>`. You can type some letters of the app and press `Enter`, it will bring up your app. For example, if you want to go to Outlook, you can just type `out` and press `Enter`. (I assume there's no much app named `out` on your mac right?)
