If you want to implement a secure OAuth solution today, it requires reading: 
  RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0 Core), 
  RFC 6750 (Bearer Tokens), 
  RFC 6819 (Threat Model and Security Considerations), 
  RFC 8252 (OAuth for Native Apps), 
  RFC 8628 (Device Grant), OAuth for Browser-Based Apps, OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice, 
  RFC 7009 (Token Revocation), 
  RFC 8414 (Authorization Server Metadata), 
  and if you’re also implementing an OAuth server, then you need to read 
  RFC 7519 (JWT), JWT Best Current Practice, JWT Profile for Access Tokens, and probably some others that I forgot. That’s a lot of material.
